# refractor.py
## Refactoring weather program

I split this weather program in to three main modules:

## Modules

* data_fetcher.py: ** contains weatherdatafetcher class, which fetches weather data for the given city.
* data_parser.py: ** Contains the DataParser class, responsible for parsing the fetched weather for the given city in to a readable format.
* user_interface.py ** The UserInterface class takes care of usr interaction and displays the weather forecast.

## How to
1. make sure python is installed
2. save all files with .py extenstion
3. run the 'user_interface.py
